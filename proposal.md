# Formal Project Proposal

## Introduction

In recent years, especially in a major city like London, public transportation has become essential to commuters and tourists. That is why for my project, I’ve decided to create a cross-platform application that can be used to make travelling around London much easier. The app will include a way to find directions between two stations (including the cost of this), public transportation maps, and specially for tourists – locations and directions to popular tourist locations. The app will be made available for both mobile and desktop devices.

## Overview

### The Problem

London is a major city and one of the most famous in the world, it is definitely not one of the easiest to navigate around. Whilst London’s public transportation is great, understanding how it works is not simple by any means. In the London Underground, everyday there will be multiple issues with multiple lines that can effect the timing of trains’ arrival, this means the timetable provided by TFL can be very unreliable.

### The Hypothesis and the Approach

The problem stated above could potentially solved if travellers were able to conveniently access train arrivals in real time, this could be done in an app. Users could very conveniently access an app on their mobile phones that will allow them to see the train arrivals as well as additional functionality, such as; maps of the London Underground, a way to find directions between two stations and a list of popular tourist locations.

My approach will be to use Javascript and the Vue.js framework to create a cross-platform mobile app. I can retrieve data about London’s public transportation by utilising TFL’s (Transport for London) own API. TFL’s API offers information such as current line statuses, live time arrivals and much more that I can implement into an app that is more user-friendly for users.

### Similar Apps

To help create the app, I have researched a couple similar and popular applications. The two that I have looked at are Google Maps and Citymapper. These are the two most commonly used applications by travellers in London to help navigate throughout the city.

Google Maps: Google Maps is definitely the most popular app used for travel worldwide. In terms of public transportation, Google Maps is capable of showing the user how to get from one location to another using public transportation. Google Maps is available on desktop platforms, as well as iOS and Android devices.

Citymapper: Citymapper is another example of a very popular app used for travelling, especially in London. In terms of public transport, Citymapper provides the most functionality. Within the Citymapper app, you are able to see the live arrivals for trains, see line statuses and much more.

### Evaluation



### Required Resources

As the project I have chosen is purely software based, no hardware is required other than a computer that is capable of running an IDE such as Visual Studio Code. As previously mentioned, I will be using Javascript, the Vue.js framework and the API provided by TFL.
