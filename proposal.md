# Formal Project Proposal

## Introduction

In recent years, especially in a major city like London, public transportation has become essential to commuters and tourists. That is why for my project, I’ve decided to create a cross-platform application that can be used to make travelling around London much easier. The app will include a way to find directions between two stations (including the cost of this), public transportation maps, and specially for tourists – locations and directions to popular tourist locations. The app will be made available for both mobile and desktop devices.
